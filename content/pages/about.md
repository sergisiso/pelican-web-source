Hi! I am Sergi. I was born in Alcarras, a small town in Catalonia. I studied Computer Engineering and I hold a Master's degree in Information Technology from the Polytechnical University of Catalonia and a MSc degree with distinction in High Performance Computing from the University of Edinburgh.
Currently, I am working as an Application Performance Engineer at the Science and Technology Facilities Council, Daresbury, UK.

I created this site as a place to gather all the things that I done or I am doing, this includes my curriculum, publications, presentations (see photo below) and some projects I have been working on. There is also a blog section in case I want to post my rumblings but I do not expect to do this any time soon :)
