Welcome to my personal site! I am a High Performance Software Engineer in the
[Hartree Centre](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx),
[Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)](https://stfc.ukri.org/), Daresbury
Laboratory, UK.

My role is the Hartree Centre is to analyse the performance and optimize scientific
and technical applications to modern parallel architectures and supercomputers.
I have work in projects with Intel (I was the PI of the Hartree Centre Intel Parallel
Computing Centre), Roll-Royce Plc, and the UK MetOffice among others. Currently I am
contributing to the open-source [PSyclone](https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone) code-generation
system for domain-specific languages.  

Additionally to my job I am coursing a PhD in the Computer Science department of the
University of Liverpool under the supervision of Jeyan Thiyagalingam, I am researching
dynamic compilation systems to identify and solve at runtime performance issues on novel
many-core architectures.

I created this site as a place to gather all the publications, presentations and
projects I have been working on.
