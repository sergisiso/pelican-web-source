Welcome to my personal site! I am a High Performance Software Engineer in the Hartree Centre, Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Daresbury Laboratory, UK. There I am the PI of the Hartree Intel Parallel Computing Centre. My main role is to analyse the performance, port and optimize scientific and technical applications to novel architectures. Complementary to my job I am coursing a PhD in the Computer Science department of the University of Liverpool, I am researching runtime systems to identify and solve performance issues on the novel many-core architectures.

I created this site as a place to gather all the things that I done or I am doing, this includes my curriculum, publications, presentations (see photo below) and some projects I have been working on. There is also a blog section in case I want to post my rumblings but I do not expect to do this any time soon :)
