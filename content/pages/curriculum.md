##Experience

###Industry
####July 2012 - Jan 2013 **Programmer at SERIMAG MEDIA SL**, Barcelona
Developed an implemented a Python document classifier for a banking application. It uses data mining technologies such as Support Vector Machines and the Viterbi algorithm.

####July 2010 - Jan 2011 **Programmer at Montajes Electricos Portoles S.A**, Fraga
Programmed Programmable Logic Controllers for many applications (solar panels, refrigeration rooms, hydraulic pumps,...) and developed web interfaces to control themremotely.

###Academia
#### Feb 2013 - Aug 2013 **Resident Student Researcher at Performance Tools Department. Barcelona Supercomputing Centre**, Barcelona
Developed and implemented a software to process summarized profiling information from highly scalable applications and format such information in a way that the Dimemas software is able to simulate its performance in different systems. It was part of the CEPBA-tools toolchain.

####Dec 2010 -Aug 2011 **Grant-holder as a cryptography researcher at Department of Cryptographyand Graphs, University of LLeida**
Developed and implemented an electronic voting system which works on different types
of homomorphic cryptosystems, specifically over elliptic curves. Studied and implemented other cryptography topics.
