<td align="left"><h4>Application Performance Engineer at <b>Science and Technology Facilities Council</b>, Daresbury, UK</h4>
<p>
I analyse the performance of technical and scientific applications in order to adapt them to newer hardware architectures and reduce their total runtime. I am part of the Intel Parallel Computing Centre which specializes in the novel Intel many-core architecture, Intel Xeon Phi. Among the applications I have been optimizing there are:
<ul>
<li> Dl_MESO LBE: A Lattice Boltzmann mesoscopic simulation package. </li>
<li>DualSPHysics: A smooth particle hydrodynamics to study free-surface flow phenomena.</li>
<li>An industrial Finite Elements solver for both inviscid and viscous compressible flows.</li>
<li>In-situ visualization workflows with OSPRay technology.</li>
</ul>
Results of the mentioned work have been presented in international conferences.
