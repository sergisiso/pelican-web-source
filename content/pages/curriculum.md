<h2 class="fa fa-wrench fa-2x" style="display:inline"></h2><h2 style="display:inline;padding-left:20px;">Experience</h2>

* Feb 2015 - present: **High Performance Software Engineer at Hartree Centre**, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Daresbury, UK
    * I analyse the performance of technical and scientific applications in order to adapt them to newer hardware architectures and reduce their total runtime. I am part of the Intel Parallel Computing Centre which specializes in the novel Intel many-core architecture, Intel Xeon Phi. Among the applications I have been optimizing there are:
        * Dl_MESO LBE: A Lattice Boltzmann mesoscopic simulation package. </li>
        * DualSPHysics: A smooth particle hydrodynamics to study free-surface flow phenomena.</li>
        * An industrial Finite Elements solver for both inviscid and viscous compressible flows.</li>
        * In-situ visualization workflows with OSPRay technology.</li>

* Feb 2013 - Aug 2013: **Resident Student Researcher at Performance Tools Department of BSC (Barcelona Supercomputing Centre)**, Barcelona
    * Developed and implemented a software to process summarized profiling information from highly scalable applications and format such information in a way that the Dimemas software is able to simulate its performance in different systems. It was part of the CEPBA-tools toolchain.


* July 2012 - Jan 2013: **Programmer at SERIMAG MEDIA SL**, Barcelona
    * Developed an implemented a Python document classifier for a banking application. It uses data mining technologies such as Support Vector Machines and the Viterbi algorithm.

* Dec 2010 -Aug 2011: **Grant-holder as a cryptography researcher at Department of Cryptographyand Graphs, University of LLeida**, Lleida
    * Developed and implemented an electronic voting system which works on different types
of homomorphic cryptosystems, specifically over elliptic curves. Studied and implemented other cryptography topics.

* July 2010 - Jan 2011: **Programmer at Montajes Electricos Portoles S.A**, Fraga
    * Programmed Programmable Logic Controllers for many applications (solar panels, refrigeration rooms, hydraulic pumps,...) and developed web interfaces to control themremotely.
