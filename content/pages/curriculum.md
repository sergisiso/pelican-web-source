<h2 class="fa fa-flask fa-2x" style="display:inline"></h2><h2 style="display:inline;padding-left:20px;">Research Interests</h2>

My research interests are in the field of High-Performance Computing (HPC), particularly
in the portability of parallel software to modern architectures. Currently, my research
focuses on how to leverage compiler-level techniques such as Domain Specific Languages
(DSLs) and Dynamic Compilation to create performant and portable software abstractions
between the application domain and the computational characteristics of applications
(separation of concerns).

I have been the Principal Investigator of the Intel Parallel Computer Centre at Hartree
Centre and the technical lead of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce aiming to port a FE
application to many-core CPU architecture. Currently I am a contributor to the PSyclone
code-generator open-source tool, I am an investigator in the EU EuroEXA project, and
I am a member of the Intel eXtreme Performance User Group (IXPUG) steering committee.

The results of the mentioned work have been presented in international conferences and
journals listed at the end of this document.
See the complete list of my [publications]({filename}/pages/Publications.md) and [projects]({filename}/pages/Projects.md).

<h2 class="fa fa-wrench fa-2x" style="display:inline"></h2><h2 style="display:inline;padding-left:20px;">Experience</h2>

* Feb 2015 - present: **High Performance Software Engineer at Hartree Centre**, Science and
Technology Facilities Council, Daresbury, UK
    * My role is to analyse the performance of technical and scientific applications and
adapt them to modern hardware architectures. During this period:
        * I lead the Intel Parallel Computing Centre at Hartree Centre. I contributed to DualSPHysics (a smooth particle hydrodynamics to study free-surface flow phenomena.), DL_MESO (a mesoscale Lattice Boltzmann mesoscopic simulation package), LFRic (an Earth Weather and Climate modelling system) and leveraged OSPRay for visualizations.
        * I lead a collaboration with Rolls-Royce to optimize an industrial Finite Elements solver for both inviscid and viscous compressible flows.
        * I made several contributions to the PSyclone codebase. For instance, as part of the EuroEXA project, I developed an OpenCL back-end for the PSyclone that can target FPGA architectures.

* Feb 2013 - Aug 2013: **Resident Student Researcher at Performance Tools Department of BSC (Barcelona Supercomputing Centre)**, Barcelona
    * Designed and implemented a software to process summarized profiling information from highly scalable applications and format such information in a way that the Dimemas software is able to simulate its performance in different systems. It was part of the CEPBA-tools toolchain.


* July 2012 - Jan 2013: **Programmer at SERIMAG MEDIA SL**, Barcelona
    * Designed an implemented a Python document classifier for a banking application. It uses data mining technologies such as Support Vector Machines and the Viterbi algorithm.

* Dec 2010 -Aug 2011: **Grant-holder as a cryptography researcher at Department of Cryptographyand Graphs, University of LLeida**, Lleida
    * Designed and implemented an electronic voting system which works on different types
of homomorphic cryptosystems, specifically over elliptic curves. Studied and implemented other cryptography topics.

* July 2010 - Jan 2011: **Programmer at Montajes Electricos Portoles S.A**, Fraga
    * Programmed Programmable Logic Controllers for many applications (solar panels, refrigeration rooms, hydraulic pumps,...) and developed web interfaces to control themremotely.
