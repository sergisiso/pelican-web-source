#### 2014 [Parallelisation of the Coupled Coherent States quantum dynamics simulation](https://static.ph.ed.ac.uk/dissertations/hpc-msc/2013-2014/Parallelisation%20of%20the%20Coupled%20Coherent%20States%20quantum%20dynamics%20simulation.pdf) MSc in HPC dissertation

The Coupled Coherent States is a quantum molecular dynamics method which solves the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation in a basis of semi-classical trajectories in an attempt to avoid exponential scaling. This makes it able to simulate and study the time evolution of photochemical reactions.
This current project studies the performance of the Coupled Coherent States method and explores its potential parallelism. It proposes a parallel version of the simulation in order run the software faster and more accurately.
The simulation is divisible in two parts where different parallelisation approaches are used. The generation of the trajectories represents an embarrassingly parallel problem and can be solved with a task distribution solution. The propagation of the trajectories needs to solve a ODE, which represent a highly coupled problem. To solve it, the parallisation of the Runge-Kutta Cash-Karp method, the implementation of a parallel derivation routine and the use of parallel lineal algebra routines (ScaLAPACK) are proposed.
The final implementation achieves a speedup of x10 in the first part of the simulation, the generation of trajectories, and a x4.5 in the second part, the propagation of the trajectories, when they are run on 12 processors. Suggestions for further development of the parallel CCS code are also presented.

#### 2013 [Simulating parallel systems using summarized application information](http://upcommons.upc.edu/pfc/handle/2099.1/18972), MTI master thesis

Examine and analyse how we can use the summarized information of parallel applications generated by the Extrae instrumentation tool in order to model the behavior of the application in a feasible way to predict its impact and the performance in different architectures.


####2011 [An electronic voting platform with elliptic curve cryptography](http://repositori.udl.cat/handle/10459.1/45765), Bachelor final thesis

This document is part of a wider project which presents an e-Voting platform based on elliptic curve cryptography. It uses an hybrid combination of two of the main e-Voting paradigms to guarantee privacy and security in the counting phase, these are precisely, the mixnets and the homomorphic protocols. This document is focused in the description of the system and the maths and programming needed to solve the homomorphic part of it. In later chapters, there is a comparison between a simple mixing system and our system proposal.
