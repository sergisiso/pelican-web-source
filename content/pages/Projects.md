**Contributing to [PSyclone](https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone)**
<br>
PSyclone is a code generation system developed for use in finite
element, finite volume and finite difference codes. Notably, it is used 
in the [LFRic
project](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/lfric).
PSyclone is also being extended to support an API being developed in the [GOcean
project](https://puma.nerc.ac.uk/trac/GOcean) for two finite difference ocean model benchmarks, one of which is based
on the [NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/) ocean model. More information on [PSyclone
ReadTheDocs](https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).


**Developing Doping (code not released yet)**
<br>
Doping (Dynamic OPtimization INjector) is a tool to embed a dynamic
recompilation infrastructure to C and C++ applications in order to
optimize (and improve the vectorization) of loops. The tools targets
traditional HPC applications and leverages the additional contextual
information available at run-time to perform the optimizations. 


**Developing multiperf (code not released yet)**
<br>
multiperf is a parallel performance analysis tool build on top of the *Linux
perf* tool. It also contains a JS frontend for interactive visualization of
the produced traces.

**Contribution to [Hartree Advance Programming
Course](https://gitlab.com/hartreetraining/openmp-training-2018)**

**Developed [DL_MESO MiniLBE](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_MESO.aspx) branch**
<br>
DL\_MESO is a mesoscale simulation package that supports both Lattice Boltzmann
Equation (LBE) and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) methods. The MiniLBE
branch provides and implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann simulation designed
to take advantage of highly parallel architectures with long vector units.

**Developed tools for analysis of aggregated traces for Dimemas**

**Developed a platform for Hybrid Elliptic Curve Cryptographic e-voting systems**

**University coursework projects:**

* [Actor Pattern Frog disease
  simulation](https://github.com/sergisiso/actor-pattern-framework)
